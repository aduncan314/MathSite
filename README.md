# Math Test

### Purpose
This is (will be) a tool that allows teachers to create tests tailored to their
curriculum of choice. The tool should provide customizable options for test questions
that allow more depth than paper tests.

### Getting started
At this point... it doesn't work

### Goals
- teachers should be able to edit questions and tests in a natural way
- questions should be interactive when possible
- paper/bubble sheet options should also be available
